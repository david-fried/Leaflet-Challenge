# Used Leaflet to Create Visualizations

## Basic Map (Leaflet-Step-1)

Used JavaScript Leaflet to visualize earthquake data gathered from the United States Geological Survey feed (USGS; http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). The map plots the location (latitude and longitude) of each earthquake. Data markers reflect the magnitude of each earthquake by its size and depth: Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. Created a legend. Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

## Advanced Map (Leaflet-Step-2)

Created a second map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. A number of base maps and layer controls were included.
